# Postmortem Report: Outage Incident

## Issue Summary:
- **Duration:** May 7, 2024, 10:00 AM - May 7, 2024, 2:00 PM (UTC)
- **Impact:** The user authentication service experienced intermittent failures, leading to login issues for approximately 30% of users.
- **Root Cause:** Database connection pool exhaustion due to unexpected spike in user traffic.

## Timeline:
- **9:55 AM:** Monitoring alert triggered due to increased latency in user authentication requests.
- **10:00 AM:** Issue officially detected as users began reporting login failures.
- **10:05 AM:** Engineering team notified and investigation initiated.
- **10:15 AM:** Assumptions made that the issue might be related to database overload due to recent feature deployment.
- **10:30 AM:** Database queries optimized and cache configuration adjusted as initial mitigation steps.
- **11:00 AM:** Issue persists despite initial actions; misleading assumption regarding cache performance explored.
- **11:30 AM:** Incident escalated to database administration team for further analysis.
- **12:00 PM:** Database connection pool exhaustion identified as the root cause.
- **12:30 PM:** Database connection pool settings adjusted to accommodate increased traffic.
- **1:30 PM:** User authentication service restored to normal operation.

## Root Cause and Resolution:
- **Root Cause:** Unexpected spike in user traffic led to database connection pool exhaustion, causing authentication service failures.
- **Resolution:** Database connection pool settings were increased to handle higher traffic loads, restoring service functionality.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:
- **Improvements/Fixes:** Enhance monitoring to proactively detect traffic spikes, optimize database queries for efficiency, implement auto-scaling for database resources.
- **Tasks:**
  1. Implement real-time monitoring for database connection pool usage.
  2. Conduct load testing to simulate traffic spikes and validate database scalability.
  3. Review cache configuration to optimize performance during peak usage.
  4. Document incident response procedures for similar scenarios.
